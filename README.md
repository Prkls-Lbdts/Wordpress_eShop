e-Business 2025–26 Project

Home Interior Decoration eShop with WordPress & WooCommerce

This repository contains the implementation of an e-commerce website developed for the e-Business (e-Επιχειρείν) 2025–26 course. The purpose of this project is to provide students with the necessary technical knowledge and practical experience required to design and implement a complete online store that, beyond standard purchasing functionality, also supports key e-marketing techniques.

The online store was developed using WordPress and the free e-commerce plugin WooCommerce. The store represents a home interior decoration business offering a variety of products such as small furniture, decorative objects, rugs, home textiles, kitchenware, and larger furniture items. The website can be implemented either in Greek or in English.

The project includes the full installation and configuration of WordPress and WooCommerce, along with the application of a theme that matches the profile of a home décor business. A custom logo was designed and integrated into the website to reflect the brand identity of the store.

The product catalog is structured using a two-level categorization system consisting of main categories and subcategories. A minimum of 30 products were added and distributed evenly across the categories. Each product includes a name, detailed description, price, stock information, image, dimensions, and any additional relevant specifications depending on the type of product.

At least three products were created as variable products, each including a minimum of two attributes such as color, size, or material. Some variations include different images depending on the selected option.

The homepage is a static page that includes a slideshow banner with clickable links directing users to featured products or categories. It also displays at least four best-selling products and at least three top-rated products based on customer reviews. Additionally, two promotional display banners were designed and placed on the homepage, each containing a clear call-to-action that directs users to the corresponding product page.

The shop page provides filtering functionality with at least two filtering criteria, such as color, size, or price range. Users are informed about GDPR regulations upon their first visit to the store through a popup or similar mechanism.

A dynamic blog page was created containing at least five posts related to the products or business news. Each post displays a thumbnail image, title, and publication date.

A static contact page was developed including the business contact details, a physical store address (sample address), an embedded map using a Google Maps integration plugin, and a contact form.

Regarding payments, the store supports only Cash on Delivery and manual bank transfer. The Cash on Delivery fee is configured as €3.50 for Greece and €10.00 for other countries. This fee is set separately from shipping costs. The store also charges shipping fees for both domestic and international orders, with different pricing configured accordingly.

Three different coupons were created with different rules and availability conditions, such as free shipping, percentage discount on the total order, or discount on specific products or categories. At least two of these coupons can be combined in the same order under the appropriate conditions. A minimum of five test orders were completed, with two marked as completed. At least three orders successfully used a coupon, and one order used two coupons simultaneously.

At least ten customer reviews were added across three different products, including ratings and comments. The highest-rated products are displayed on the homepage.

The footer was customized to include the store logo, physical address, contact information, social media links, and links to important pages such as Terms of Use, Shipping & Payment Methods, FAQ, and Contact.

To enhance security, a security plugin was installed to provide firewall protection, login security, and protection against brute-force attacks. Additional measures such as IP blocking or admin URL modification may also have been applied.

An accessibility plugin was installed to improve usability for users with disabilities by supporting features such as font resizing, contrast adjustment, and improved navigation compatibility.

Finally, at least two additional WordPress plugins were installed to extend the functionality of the store, such as SEO optimization tools, advanced product variation display plugins, contact form enhancements, or performance optimization tools.

Through this project, students gained practical experience in building a complete e-commerce website, managing products and orders, implementing marketing techniques, ensuring GDPR compliance, improving accessibility and security, and effectively using WordPress and WooCommerce in a real-world business context.
